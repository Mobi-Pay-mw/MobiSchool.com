# THIS MOBISCHOOL YOUR NUMBER 1 LEARNING PLATFORM.

##GitHub Rules

please comment on your code ( I've started you'll see it in the web.php file), and most importantly code that will be used by other members.

make sure your branches are always up to date and in sync with the main branch, this is your responsibility.

make sure you commit code that is indented and well-commented to make it easier for users to resolve conflicts when they arise.
